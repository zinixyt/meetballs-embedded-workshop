# \<Meetballs/\> Intro to coding on embedded systems

In this session, we will delve into the fascinating world of embedded systems and learn how to code for them using an emulated arduino and ESP32.

**if you come from python or javascript, the `;` will be your arch nemesis**

## 1. Let's setup our environment

First, you are going to need a Wokwi account, you can sign up with *Google*, *Github* or *Email*

1. Go to the [Wokwi website](https://wokwi.com).
2. On the top-right corner of the page, click the `SIGN IN/UP` button and choose the method of your choice.

- [Click this link](https://wokwi.com/projects/new/arduino-uno) to create a new Arduino project!
- [Click this link](https://wokwi.com/projects/new/esp32) to create a new ESP32 project!

Now that we are set up, we can start coding! Well, not yet...
