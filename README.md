# \<Meetballs/\> Intro to coding on embedded systems

In this session, we will delve into the fascinating world of embedded systems and learn how to code for them using an emulated ESP32.

## 1. Let's setup our environment

First, you are going to need a wokwi account, you can sign up with *Google*, *Github* or *Email*

1. Go to the [Wokwi website](https://wokwi.com).
2. On the top-right corner of the page, click the `SIGN IN/UP` button and choose the method of your choice.
3. [Click this link](https://wokwi.com/projects/new/esp32) to create a new ESP32 project!

Now that we are set up, we can start coding! Well, not yet...
