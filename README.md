# \<Meetballs/\> Intro to coding on embedded systems

In this session, we will delve into the fascinating world of embedded systems and learn how to code for them using an emulated ESP32.

## 1. Let's setup our environment!

It's suggested you use Visual Studio Code for this session and you will need the following extensions:

| Name            | Link                                                                                    | Purpose |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Arduino         |[Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino) |Just for the syntax highlighting|
| Wokwi Simulator |[Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Wokwi.wokwi-vscode)           |The actual emulator|

Now that you have the extensions installed, you can clone this repo inside a folder of your choice

``` batch
git clone 
```
